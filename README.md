# HeterophilySpecificModels

This repo contains code to reproduce evaluation of heterophily-specific models on datasets from [A critical look at evaluation of GNNs under heterophily: Are we really making progress?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=tJbbQfw-5wv) paper.

To reproduce evaluation of a model, please refer to the *Run code* section in README in a folder containing selected model.
